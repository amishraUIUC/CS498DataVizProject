					<h1>The New Household Names</h1>
					<p>Over a long period of time, the top market capitalized companies have changed very rapidly due to how fast technology was evolving. However, today is a unique situation where the largest U.S. companies are dominating industries to an extent never seen before.</p>
					<p>This visualization to the right shows the market capitalization of a select few companies since 2009 - marking the wake of the Great Financial Crisis. GE, XOM and IBM - General Electric, Exxon Mobil, and International Business Machines respectively, were amongst the largest US companies before the market crash of 2008. AAPL, AMZN and MSFT - Apple, Amazon and Microsoft respectively - are in today's top 5 largest US companies (notably all technology companies). The visualization is a multi-lines chart which shows the market capitalization of these six companies over the period of 2009 to current day; each data point represents the market capitalization at the beginning of the year except for the 2018 point which shows the most current market cap figure.</p>

				<div class="summary-year" data-year="2009">
					<h1>2009</h1>
					<p>The visualization starts at the beginning of 2009 during the Great Financial Crisis. The worst is almost over as Bear Stearns has collapsed, mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are taken over by the government, Lehman has filed for bankruptcy and Congress has approved the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary-year" data-year="2010">
					<h1>2010</h1>
					<p>In the wake of the mortgage crisis, stocks were reeling from massive losses and were finally getting supported by the Federal Reserve’s QE 1 (Quantitative Easing 1) program which started in March 2009. This program revolved around the Fed purchases large amounts of mortgage-backed securities and debt. The purpose of such a program was to stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply. This program did not work initially as stocks fell and made new lows in early 2009; however, stocks rallied the rest of the year with further support from the government (TARP) and the Federal Reserve. By the beginning of 2010, the broad market has nearly doubled in the beginning since March 2009.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary-year" data-year="2011">
					<h1>2011</h1>
					<p>The market has a variable year with no real growth over the 2010-2011 period as contagion fears grow. The Federal Reserve starts another round of quantitative easing known as QE2 which is mostly identical to QE1. All six stocks have gained some ground in the year but no stock has taken charge just yet. Apple is showing the early signs of growing into America’s largest company as it releases the iPad in early 2010.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary-year" data-year="2012">
					<h1>2012</h1>
					<p>The stock market and economy continue to recover but the six stocks remains relatively stable except for Apple which is establishing a strong uptrend. Unemployment continues to be a dampening factor on the recovery and overseas macroeconomic fears concern investors. By now the Fed’s purchases of debt has surpassed two trillion dollars. </p>
					<p>Apple continues its charge on by surpassing XOM in market cap and being worth more than $300 billion for the first time. The other five stocks remain fairly stable and slowly recovering. Apple’s success can be attributed to its rapid innovation in the iPhone space and release of the iCloud. </p>
					<p>Amazon still remains a sleeper as it focuses on heavy spending to stay ahead of its competitors and grow its brand to become synonymous with e-commerce.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary-year" data-year="2013">
					<h1>2013</h1>
					<p>The Federal Reserve starts a third round of Quantitative Easing known as QE 3 (also called QE Infinity since it had no defined end). This program would constitute the Fed purchasing a steady amount of mortgage-backed securities every month until the Fed decides to stop. The program started with $40 bil per month in September 2012 and rose to $85 billion per month in December. </p>
					<p>The stock market had begun to show signs of positive upward trajectory by getting close to breaking the all-time-high S&P 500 pricce from 2007. Apple continues charging on by dominating the smart-phone scene and Amazon begins its strong uptrend with its rapid expansion and growth. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary-year" data-year="2014">
					<h1>2014</h1>
					<p>The Federal Reserve continues to provide quantitative easing all throughout 2013-2014 and has helped support the economic recovery and investor confidence. The S&P 500 index finally breaks the all-time-high from 2007 and continues rallying throughout the year as every pullback quickly reverts into new all-time-highs. Apple, Microsoft and Amazon all show signs of early tech domination while XOM, GE and IBM are still relatively flat for about five years now. </p>
					<p>Amazon’s steady growth in e-commerce market share correlates with the gain in its market value over the past five years (Amazon stands at ~30% of the e-commerce market share in 2014). Apple continues to dominate the tablet and smartphone space by becoming the largest and most recognizable phone brand and rapidly releasing new products for the insatiable consumers. As the technology sector continues to boom, Microsoft silently reaps the benefits with its licensing business model and its new and rapidly growing intelligent cloud services. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary-year" data-year="2015">
					<h1>2015</h1>
					<p>The stock market charges on even more in the 2014-2015 time range with the S&P 500 breaking 2000 for the first time. The Federal Reserve stops QE3 in late 2014, topping out at about $4.5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities purchases. This news proves to be a big shock to the market as it hits a brick wall late in the year and also for most of 2015. This is the first time period where there is a noticeable shift from old value to new value where GE, XOM and IBM lose a lot in market value while Apple, Microsoft and Amazon rally ahead. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary-year" data-year="2016">
					<h1>2016</h1>
					<p>This time period proves to be one very frustrating for investors due to the market’s rangebound nature. Many events shake investors this year – two of the most notable are the August flash crash and first interest rate hike in December. The stock market crashes about 13% in the matter of a few days for no apparent reason and takes a few months just to recover only to get hit with another worry of rising interest rates. With the end of Quantitate Easing and beginning of the Fed’s tightening policy by raising rates for the first time (+0.25%) in December 2015, investors begin to worry that the stock seven year bull-run is ending. For all six stocks, this is a fairly variable but overall flat year.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary-year" data-year="2017">
					<h1>2017</h1>
					<p>This period of 2016-2017 marks to be one of the most important of this decade for the financial markets with two huge events – Brexit and the U.S. presidential elections. Brexit provided a large shock to the market but investors quickly stepped in and purchased the dip. Shortly after Brexit, the market finally breaks out of its range since late 2014 and makes a new all-time-high. The market has jitters pre-election but after Donald Trump’s victory, it rallies on strongly making new all-time highs all throughout December.</p>
					<p>This is the year where it is evident that tech has cemented itself as new value over the old dogs of GE, XOM and IBM. All three tech stocks are now worth more than GE, XOM and IBM and enjoy huge gains in this time period. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="summary-year" data-year="2018">
					<h1>2018</h1>
					<p>Since Donald Trump’s inauguration to current day, the market has shown complete preferential treatment to technology over any other sector. IBM and GE lose their status as value stocks due to falling revenue and profitability while AAPL, AMZN and MSFT continue to show unbelievable growth in the smartphone/tablet, e-commerce and cloud markets respectively. Trump’s policies have been very positive to the three tech stocks and not so much to the three old value stocks – specifically the tax plan was a great boon to most Nasdaq 100 stocks. 2017 becomes the year where the Nasdaq becomes the best place to park your money – 10-20 years the strategy would be to invest in GE for sustained growth and dividends, XOM for exposure to an energy industry enjoying rising energy prices and IBM for domination of the computer space. Despite many market shocks, tech has always rebounded and the big three continue to get rapidly bought up as investors search for yield; meanwhile, the old value stocks fade out as investors are looking to the future.</p>
